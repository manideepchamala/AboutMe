Iam from India and i have completed my  undergraduation in 2019 and so i dont have a real time working experience . I was very much into sports all my student life till now and iam kind of new into this technical life. So initally iam looking forward to build my basics well and get thorough with the advanced topics ,though i know iam late i would like to make a move in this aspect. Iam from computer science department. I was a captain of my college cricket team and kabadi team and so sports were my major hobbies all this time.

Quite obvious that i dont have an exact plan for now but am interested in creating web pages or something like that because languages like HTML is interesting and also data base topics may be.

Also looking forward to develop some Gaming apps ,that might take some time  so ill be working on it after a while and for now iam a kind of going with the flow person
